            Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide
            complete beginners to web development with all that they need to
            start coding websites.

          <p className="paragraph">
            The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to
            "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From
            there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from{" "}
            <a href="#"> the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to advanced
            resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.

            If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging
            we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel
            comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home
            whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or
            as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a
            hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web
            technologies work.
